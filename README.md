## The food finder app based on price

This app was created using javascript and ajax calls to the Zomato API and the Giphy API

## Instructions

Input your city and state. Then choose a food type from the dropdown list of options, how far you're willing to travel, and your price range.

The app returns restaurant results with chosen criteria and gifs of the type of food you chose.
